# crypto-algorithms-spdx

This repository is a subset of the information available in the http://github.com/scanoss/crypto-algorithms-open-dataset repository. It provides a list of cryptography algorithms found by SCANOSS through mining most available published open source. In addition, a template of what it could the origin of a taxonomy that would allow to standardize how to declare crypto algorithms complement the information provided on this repo.

Please do not commit any change to this repository. Its The goal is to provide to SPDX an starting point for their work on creating a taxonomy to declare crypto algorithms.
